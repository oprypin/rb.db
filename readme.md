# rb.db

This repository ultimately generates an SQLite database file containing tables from [Rebrickable Downloads](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/) and a few custom tables and views, non-trivially generated from them.

Database documentation is best read on GitHub Pages: [https://ojuuji.github.io/rb.db/](https://ojuuji.github.io/rb.db/).

## How to Build

Ready-to-use and up-to-date database file is always available in the [Releases](https://github.com/ojuuji/rb.db/releases/latest) section.

If you want to built it yourself, there are two ways to do this: build locally and build using GitHub Actions (so GitHub builds it for you and the database file is published in the repository Releases section).

### Build via GitHub Actions

This is the easiest way but it takes long to complete. So if you want to try some modifications, this way might be suboptimal.

Fork the repository, then go to `Actions` tab → select `build` workflow → click `Run workflow` split button → click `Run workflow` button. The build workflow will start, and once it completes, the database will be published in the Releases section of the repository.

If you want to build on a schedule, first enable scheduled workflow (they are disabled by default in forks). Go to `Actions` tab → select `schedule` workflow → click `Enable workflow` button. It is also recommended to update [cron expression](https://github.com/ojuuji/rb.db/blob/master/.github/workflows/schedule.yml#L5) in this case (set different time).

### Build Locally

This way you build `rb.db` file manually on your PC.

To build `rb.db` locally you need Python (tested on 3.12) and Bash (on Windows you can use Git Bash).

Run these commands in Bash shell:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ojuuji/rb.db.git
cd rb.db
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
./build.sh
```

Or instead of `./build.sh` run `./build.sh -rbonly` if you want to generate `rb.db` containing only [Rebrickable tables](https://ojuuji.github.io/rb.db/#rebrickable-tables) without [custom tables](https://ojuuji.github.io/rb.db/#custom-tables).

On Windows you might have better luck with `py -m venv .venv` command instead of `python -m venv .venv`. Also use `source .venv/Scripts/activate` instead of `source .venv/bin/activate`.

After the script completes, you will find the generated `rb.db` file in the `data` directory.

You can query it without additional setup using Python:

```sh
python -m sqlite3 data/rb.db "your sql statement"
```

Example:

```sh
$ python -m sqlite3 data/rb.db "select count(*), part_material from parts group by part_material"
(3001, 'Cardboard/Paper')
(948, 'Cloth')
(40, 'Flexible Plastic')
(57, 'Foam')
(17, 'Metal')
(55191, 'Plastic')
(303, 'Rubber')
```

Or you can use [sqlite3 CLI](https://sqlite.org/cli.html). All examples in documentation use this way.
